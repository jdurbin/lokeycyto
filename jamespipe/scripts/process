0  Convert crlf to lf
	tr '\r' '\n' < PlateMap2.csv > PlateMap2.lf.csv

1. Convert data file to csv and remove all crazy characters from heading (1 minute)
	tab2CSVAndFixHeader inFile > outFile
	
2. Cell values spread over multiple rows, merge all values for a cell into single row (9 min, in RAM)
	mergeCellRows inFile > outFile
	
3. Create h2 database (5 minutes)
	dbcreate dataFile platemapFile dbName

4. Extract per compound files (2.5min/each, 60 minutes for all 22)
	extractPerCompoundFiles CP2DB percompound/
	
5. Generate distribution plots, split out by titration (10 minutes per compound) 


=========================

6. Generate control vs compound Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics
	-> input: two per-compound files. 
	-> output: one file per compound. 
		
6a Modify to compute z-scores. 

7. Plot heat map

8. Cluster?

TODO:  

* Output tab or something other than an h2 database (or stuff into a fixed MySQL database)
* 

Want to generate compounds by Compound+titration vs features, where each (r,c) contains the 
K-S or other statistic for that compound for that feature and that titration.

Smooth out values with exponentially decaying neighbor weighting 
Sum up differences between control and sample values to get a statistic.  Plot that statistic.
